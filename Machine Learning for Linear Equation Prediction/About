Machine Learning for Linear Equation Prediction

Description:- You are tasked with developing a machine learning model that can predict linear equations based on a given dataset. The dataset consists of pairs of input variables and 
corresponding output values, representing different linear equations. Your goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the coefficients of a linear equation given new input values.


Requirements:-
Dataset Generation:-
• Generate a dataset of multiple linear equations, each represented by a pair of input variables and the corresponding output value.
• Ensure that the dataset includes a variety of linear equations with different slopes and intercepts.
• You can use a random generator or predefined equations to create the dataset.Data Pre-processing:
• Perform any necessary pre-processing steps on the dataset, such as data normalization or standardization, to ensure better model performance.
